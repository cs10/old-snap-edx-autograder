To get an updated version of snap, navigate to this folder from your shell/terminal, and run "sh update-snap.sh". This will generate a new version of snap called "edx-snap." Inside "edx-snap," the three most important files are snap.html, snap.js, and lab-add-ons.js. Whenever you want to update snap on the edx course, you'll need to upload these three files to the "file uploads" section of the edx course.
